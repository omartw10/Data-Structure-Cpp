# 🧩 Data Structures in C++

This repository is a collection of **fundamental Data Structure implementations** written in **C++**, designed for learning and practice purposes.

Each structure is implemented from scratch using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to help understand how data is stored, accessed, and managed in memory.

## 🧠 Included Data Structures (in progress)

| Data Structure | Status | Description |
|----------------|:-------:|-------------|
| 🧮 **Arrays** | ✅ Completed | Basic dynamic array operations (fill, display, append, insert, delete, search). |
| 🔗 **Linked Lists** | 🚧 In progress | Coming soon... |
| 📚 **Stacks** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon... |
| 🧾 **Queues** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon... |
| 🌲 **Trees** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon... |

## 🧮 Current Implementation — Arrays

The **Array** class demonstrates how to manage a dynamic array manually, without using STL containers.  
It supports operations like:
- Create and fill an array  
- Display contents  
- Append a new item  
- Search by value  
- Insert at a specific index  
- Delete by index  

📂 File: `Array.cpp`

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

1. Open this repository in **Visual Studio Code** or any C++ IDE.  
2. Make sure you have a **C++ compiler** installed (`g++` recommended).  
3. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   g++ Array.cpp -o Array
   ./Array
````

4. Follow the instructions shown in the console.

## 💡 Recommended Extension

For better code readability, install the VS Code extension:

> **Better Comments**

This extension highlights comment tags (like `//? === SECTION === //`)
so you can easily understand the structure of the code.
