# 🧩 Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** using **C++**, built manually without STL to help beginners understand how each structure behaves internally.

Each structure is coded using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and designed to be readable, clean, and easy for students to follow.

The project will continue to grow as more structures are completed.

## 📌 Included Data Structures (Status)

| Data Structure | Status | File |
|----------------|:------:|------|
| 🧮 Arrays | ✅ Completed | `Array.cpp` |
| 🔗 Linked List (Singly) | ✅ Completed | `LinkedList.cpp` |
| 📚 Stack (Linked Implementation) | ✅ Completed | `Stack.cpp` |
| 🧾 Queue | ⏳ Coming Soon | — |
| 🌲 Trees | ⏳ Coming Soon | — |

## 🧮 Arrays (Completed)

Basic array functionality implemented manually:

- Fill  
- Display  
- Append  
- Insert  
- Delete  
- Search  

📄 File: `Array.cpp`

---

## 🔗 Linked List (Completed)

A singly linked list implementation covering:

- Insert at beginning  
- Append  
- Insert before a given value  
- Search  
- Delete item  
- Count items  
- Display the list  

📄 File: `LinkedList.cpp`

---

## 📚 Stack (Completed)

A **Stack** implemented using a linked list structure:

- `push()` — Add item to top  
- `pop()` — Remove and return top item  
- `peek()` — Read top item  
- `isEmpty()`  
- `isFound()` — Search for a value  
- `count()` — Total elements  
- `display()` — Visualize stack (top → bottom)  

This helps in understanding stack behavior (LIFO) with dynamic memory.

📄 File: `Stack.cpp`

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

Compile any file using:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
````

Example:

```bash
g++ Stack.cpp -o stack
./stack
```

## 🧔 Author

Developed by **Omar**
A progressive learning project focused on writing core data structures in C++ manually.

## 📅 Project Goal

Build a full educational set of manually implemented data structures:

✔ Arrays
✔ Linked Lists
✔ Stacks
⏳ Queues
⏳ Trees

All coded from scratch, without STL, to strengthen understanding of how each structure works internally.
