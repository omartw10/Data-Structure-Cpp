# 🧩 Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** using **C++**.  
Each structure is coded from scratch using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to help beginners understand how data is organized, stored, and manipulated in memory.

The project is built step-by-step, and new data structures are added as they are completed.

---

## 📌 Included Data Structures (Status)

| Data Structure | Status | File |
|----------------|:------:|------|
| 🧮 Arrays | ✅ Completed | `Array.cpp` |
| 🔗 Linked Lists (Singly) | ✅ Completed | `linked-lists.cpp` |
| 📚 Stacks | ⏳ Coming Soon | — |
| 🧾 Queues | ⏳ Coming Soon | — |
| 🌲 Trees | ⏳ Coming Soon | — |

## 🧮 Arrays (Completed)

The **Array** implementation includes basic operations such as:

- Fill  
- Display  
- Append  
- Insert  
- Delete  
- Search  

This helps beginners understand how arrays work internally without using STL containers.

📄 File: `Array.cpp`

---

## 🔗 Linked List (Completed)

The **Singly Linked List** implementation includes:

- Insert at beginning  
- Append  
- Insert before a specific value  
- Search for an element  
- Delete an element  
- Display list contents  
- Count number of elements  

This structure demonstrates dynamic memory handling and pointer manipulation in an easy and readable way.

📄 File: `LinkedList.cpp`

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

Use the following commands for any file:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
````

Example:

```bash
g++ LinkedList.cpp -o linkedlist
./linkedlist
```

## 📅 Project Goal

Build a complete educational collection of C++ Data Structures including:

✔ Arrays
✔ Linked Lists
⏳ Stacks
⏳ Queues
⏳ Trees

All implemented manually, without STL, to strengthen understanding of how each structure truly works.
