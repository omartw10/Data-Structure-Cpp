# 🧮 Array Class in C++

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a **dynamic array** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++.  
It helps beginners understand how arrays work internally by implementing common operations manually.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Create a custom-size array  
✅ Fill array elements manually  
✅ Display array content  
✅ Append a new item  
✅ Search for an element  
✅ Insert an item at a specific index  
✅ Delete an element by index  

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code** or any C++ IDE.  
2. Make sure you have a **C++ compiler** installed (for example: `g++`).  
3. Compile and run the program using:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ./main
````

4. Follow the program instructions in the terminal.
